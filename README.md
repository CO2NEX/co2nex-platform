# 🌍 CO2NEX Platform

> MVP under development — this repo will document the platform’s evolution and tech decisions as they happen.

## 🔧 Overview

This repository serves as the **development ground for the CO2NEX MVP platform and dashboard** — the core interface for real-time carbon credit verification, certification, and trading.

CO2NEX is on a mission to make carbon markets **transparent, fast, and verifiable at planetary scale**, powered by AI, satellite data, blockchain, and human intelligence.

This repo will track:
- Core platform architecture
- Frontend and backend evolution
- API integrations
- Infrastructure choices
- Dev tools and workflows

## 📦 What’s Inside (Planned)

- `frontend/` — React-based or SvelteKit dashboard UI
- `backend/` — API layer, database models, authentication
- `services/` — Integration with satellite data, IoT, GIS, etc.
- `docs/` — Technical documentation, architecture decisions, feature specs
- `scripts/` — Deployment helpers, DevOps tooling

## 🧱 Tech Stack (WIP)

We are evaluating and integrating the following components:

- **Frontend:** TypeScript + React/SvelteKit
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express/NestJS), Python (FastAPI)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + Redis (for caching)
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum + ZK Rollups (Polygon / StarkNet)
- **Auth:** OAuth2 + Web3 wallet integration
- **Infra:** Docker, CI/CD, GitHub Actions, Terraform

> We’re building in public — expect fast iteration, open discussion, and continuous evolution.

## 🛠️ Contributing

We will open up contribution guidelines as the MVP stabilizes.
