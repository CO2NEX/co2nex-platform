> **Prototype Notice:**  
> This is the **Alpha version (v1.0.0)** of the CO2NEX Carbon Harvest Calculator. The layout is active and reflects the planned design and methodology, but **not all backend functions (e.g., form submission, dynamic calculations)** are currently functional. This is a visual and conceptual preview of what’s to come.

## 🧪 Methodology (V1 Estimation Model)

We’ve built this calculator using **real-world scientific proxies**, especially adapted for **Brazilian biomes**. Our full MRV system includes high-accuracy remote sensing, field calibration, and AI verification (coming soon).

### Core Equation:

```text
Estimated CO2 = Area (ha) × Annual Sequestration Rate × Project Duration (years)
```

### Estimated Annual Sequestration Rates (tCO2e/ha/year):

| Land Type | Average Rate |
|-----------|--------------|
| Forest Conservation | 1.5 |
| Re/Afforestation | 8.0 |
| Regenerative Agriculture | 1.0 |
| Conventional Agriculture | 0.0 |
| Improved Pasture | 0.7 |
| Wetland Restoration | 5.0 |

> 📌 Note: These are **baseline estimates**. Actual credit issuance depends on **CO2NEX MRV verification**.

---

## 📊 Outputs

- **Estimated Annual Sequestration** – tCO2e/year
- **Total Carbon Value (if duration is set)** – tCO2e total
- **Annual Revenue Estimate** – In user-selected currency
- **Total Projected Revenue** – Over full project period

---

## 🧱 Calculator Stack

- **Tailwind CSS** – Responsive, sleek frontend
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** – Interactive form logic
- **Live Math Engine** – Real-time outputs with on-change updates
- **Open Architecture** – Plug in your own biome or region
